# Fluentbit_Wazuh
 Fluentbit configuration file for correctly reading wazuh-manager and wazuh-indexer alerts.json files in docker mode.
 How to install -> https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/installation/getting-started-with-fluent-bit
 
 Notes: I still couldn't make fluentbit work in docker mode and read the alerts.json files. When I have more time, I'll look into it.
